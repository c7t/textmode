bugs:
  - standing on ladder (but not 'on' ladder) == can't descend
  - can't queue keypress
  - hit head on ceiling stops you
  x jump up through floors
  x nice to push down to stop

gags/ripoffs

 - asteroids
 - mario -> character eats mushroom, goes from 'c' to 'C'
 - vvvvvv - switch gravity
 - ladder / donkey kong
 - catchum / pacman
 - downwell - rocket boots, falling (needs scrolling, level generation...maybe)
 - flappy bird
 - bolo, tanks
 - micromachines - scrolling
 - witness - preachy public domain text for no reason (bear-witness.txt)

bling

transitions/fades
level modification - worms terrain, etc.
enemy swarms/particles

ideas

some sort of escalation of enemies to the point that they stop being
singletons and start to act like a mass that flows and fills the level
and you can start to climb the pile to escape

---

progression

cheesy text crawl with starfield (maybe with cursor to look even more
kindergarten) bookended with actual 3D starfiled that

moving only on key input (rogue) -> moving continuously

no gravity -> gravity

fixed screens -> scrolling

static level -> enemies

moving -> shooting -> ... crafting ... inventory ... -> talking

---

thoughts...needs actual story, writing, design, human element, fun
gameplay, mostly just a demoscene/tech demo for some dubious tech.
